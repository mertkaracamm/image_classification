# Image Classification for a City Dog Show
 
 Project Explanation: 
  
 In this project:
 
      -  I used a created image classifier to identify dog breeds using Python.
      -  The program determines which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".
      -  For this image classification; I used an image classification application using a deep learning model called CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
      -  I also used a dataset from [ImageNet] (https://image-net.org/)
